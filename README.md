#mytunes
This is a project I completed as a student at [makersquare](http://makersquare.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

We used backbone to create a music player that adds songs to a song queue upon clicking, plays the first song on the queue, removes the song from the queue when it is done playing or if the song in the queue is clicked on. This is a screenshot:
